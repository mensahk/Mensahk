This project enabled me to learn a lot about Apache 2.0 license in opensource software. Going forward, I will prefer to use Apache license because It allows users to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software under the terms of the license, without concern for royalties. Also the Apache License is permissive in that it does not require a derivative work of the software, or modifications to the original, to be distributed using the same license.
