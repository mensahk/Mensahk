Single Sign-On using Spring Boot Web Application using okta & OAuth2.0

I use the Sprint boot java development tool to set up the login for my web page. This java development tool made It easy to 

implement OAuth. The sprint boot has feature that support the OAuth2.0 security for webpages. I also Sign up with Okta where I 

got the authentication for my login website. The programmed did run correct on my IDE with no errors or problems but couldn’t 
run the browser. 

I have tried several approaches to resolve this issue but still haven’t been able to get it to run on the browser. I am 

thinking it got something to do with the version of okta and the current version of spring boot. Hence I think it’s a 

configuration problem and I am able to get it to work soon. 

To Run the program:


Unzip the file.

run it and it should show the port to use is 7070

if the localhost7070 is able to work 

the login information will be
