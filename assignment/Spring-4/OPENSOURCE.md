Reflection on Article 1

Opensource software community has provided a way for companies to come together and work towards achieve a common goal. It his helps get a lot of project done and also get different approach and perspective on projects. 
Opensource has also provided an opportunity for people to learn new language and perfect the language since these projects serve as a challenge and development as a software programmer. 

Reflection on Article 2
This article in someone is similar to the first one in the sense that, opensource software has create a community that makes it possible for people from different companies to contribute to a project. Example it was really nice and incredible to learn about the amount of people from different companies that contributed to the development of linux kernel. I Also the article talks about mentorship in the opensource community. Even though much wasnâ€™t said about the mentorship I think this will help new developers to properly navigate the environment.
