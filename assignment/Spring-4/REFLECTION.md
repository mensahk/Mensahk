Spring -4
o	Sprint Boot java is what I used to set up my login. 
o	I use Okta as my security authentication for the webpage
o	I used OAuth2 as my security. 
Port : 7070

  After going through the document, I decided to use the oauth2 for my application because it was easy to implement on spring boot java and also my research lead me to know about okta authentication which I also use in my implementation. Over all researching into this assignment enabled me to understand how google is able to use single sign on for all of it products making it easy for it users to use and not worry about creating different password for each of their platforms. I guess it takes the problem of having to remember every username and password. 
  Lastly, As said early I used spring boot java to implement my login. It complied correct with no errors and did specific the localhost that it needs to run on but for some reason itâ€™s not run. I tried to fix it but there is not much time. For time been, I will submit this and if I am able to fix it I will update this document.
